# nPush-JS
A JS clone of one of my fav terminal games - [nPush](http://npush.sourceforge.net/)

## Setup
You need to have nodejs and npm installed to build the game.
I recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).

1. Install nvm with [its setup instructions here](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation)
2. Then run `nvm install node && nvm alias default node`, which installs the latest version of Node.js and sets up your terminal so you can run it by typing node. With nvm you can install multiple versions of Node.js and easily switch between them.
3. Finally run `npm install` in the project root

## Develop
Run `npm start` in the project root. Open `index.html` in browser.

## Build
Run `npm run build` in the project root. Open `index.html` in browser.
